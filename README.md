# GoalD OSGi Execution Environment

Intro 
=====

This project intends to create an execution environment for the Goal-Driven Deployment Framework (https://github.com/lesunb/goald).
It is built on top of the OSGi technology for the creation and deployment of the bundles.

Bundles are created as java projects with OSGi metadata and exported with Maven to a repository.
The intelligence is responsible for starting an OSGi Framework, fetching the repository (with Apache Felix BundleRepository) and starting the bundles in order to provide a service.

OSGi enRoute Archetype</h1>

This repository represents a template workspace for bndtools, it is the easiest way to get started with OSGi enRoute. The workspace is useful in an IDE (bndtools or Intellij) and has support for [continuous integration][2] with [gradle][3]. If you want to get started with enRoute, then follow the steps in the [quick-start guide][1].
